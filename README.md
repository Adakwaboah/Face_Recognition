# Face_Recognition
This repository contains a jupyter notebook with python codes for implementing four faces recognition algorithms -- EigenFaces, Fisherfaces, SVM, SRC on the YaleB dataset. Error rates for five types of features (pixel intensities, PCA, LDA, LBP, and HOG) were explored as well as the effect of training data size on the recognition rates.
